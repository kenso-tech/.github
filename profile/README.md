# Kenso 🤖

Welcome to the GitHub organization of [Kenso](https://kenso.tech) :rocket:

We are currently building your gym buddy to [train smarter, get stronger, faster](https://kenso.tech).

## ✨ About Kenso

We make going to gym a frictionless experience. Our goal is to make you want to go to the gym, and stick to it. We do this by providing: 📊

- Workouts based on intensity, target muscle, split, and other desired values.
- A tracking system that knows how much weight and reps you did and gives you recommendations to improve gains.
- A machine learning model that just by sharing a quick video of you doing the exercise will tell you what to do better next time to avoid injuries.
